# environment setup
- 1. Create a virtual environment!!! **THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**. This will help you to keep your dependencies in a separate environment and not mess up with your system dependencies. And `Dockerizing the application will be easier`.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
- 2. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
- 3. Install the requirements using Makefile
```bash
make install
```

## Credentials Setup
- 1. Make sure you have the `aws credentials` in your system. If not, create one using the following command
```bash
aws configure
```
In the AWS configuration file, you will have to provide the following details:
```bash
AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

## model access setup
- 1. Login to the AWS console and go to the bedrock
- 2. click get started
- 3. On the left side, navigate to model access
- 4. Click orange botton 'manage model access'
- 5. Check box `Titan Embeddings G1 - Text` and `Titan Text G1 - Express`
- 6. Scroll down to click `request model access`
- 7. Wait for the approval. It should be immediate.

# Dockerizing the application
Dockerization can be split into 3 stages: Dockerfile, image and containerization. The Dockerfile contains the necessary instructions that needed to create a Docker image. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. These instructions define the steps needed to create a reproducible and portable containerized environment.

### Dockerfile
The main functions of a Dockerfile include:

1. **Defining the Base Image**: The Dockerfile starts by specifying the base image upon which the new image will be built. This base image typically contains a minimal operating system environment, such as Alpine Linux or Ubuntu, and may include additional software or libraries required for the application.

2. **Adding Dependencies and Application Code**: The Dockerfile includes instructions to copy files and directories from the host machine into the image. This allows you to add dependencies, configuration files, and application code to the image.

3. **Running Commands**: The Dockerfile can execute commands within the image to perform tasks such as installing packages, configuring services, and setting environment variables.

4. **Exposing Ports**: If the containerized application needs to accept network connections, the Dockerfile can specify which ports should be exposed from the container to the host system.

5. **Defining Entrypoint and Command**: The Dockerfile can specify the default command to run when the container starts, as well as any arguments or options for that command. This defines the primary process for the container.

6. **Documenting the Build Process**: A well-written Dockerfile serves as documentation for the build process, making it easy for developers to understand how the image is constructed and what dependencies are required.

Overall, the Dockerfile is a fundamental component of Docker-based development and deployment workflows. It allows developers to define the environment and configuration of their applications in a concise and repeatable way, enabling consistent and reliable deployment across different environments. 

Here we present the example of our Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
# Use an existing Docker image with Python as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements.txt file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --upgradeÂ pip

# Install any dependencies specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire current directory into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Expose port 8501 to the outside world. This is the port Streamlit runs on the container
EXPOSE 8501

# Command to run the Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]

```
### Creating docker image
**MAKE SURE YOUR DOCKER IS INSTALLED IN THE SYSTEM AND ACTIVATED**
- Build the docker image
```bash
docker build -t health-llm:001 .
```
The image has name `health-llm` and tag `001`. You can change the name and tag as per your requirement. This image will be stored in your DockerHub

### Containerization test 
- Run the docker image
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 health-llm:001
```
This will run the docker image in the port `8501`. You can change the port as per your requirement. The first port is the port in your system (in this case I ran on github codespace the default port is `8501` but if you run on local machine, it should be `8000`) and the second port is the port in the docker image. You can define the port in the `Dockerfile` as well. See `EXPOSE 8501` in the `Dockerfile`
